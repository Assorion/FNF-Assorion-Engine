# ‚öù | What is Assorion Engine?

Assorion Engine is effectively the Linux of <a href="https://ninja-muffin24.itch.io/funkin">Friday Night Funkin'</a> Engines. 
All original base Friday Night Funkin' code has been replaced with more efficient, optimized code. 

Assorion Engine doesn't have mods folder capabilities planned nor will it be implemented. 
In addition, things such as cutscenes, events, discordRPC, etc, will have to be added yourself. 
Though, Assorion Engine does have several <a href="https://github.com/Assorion/FNF-Assorion-Engine#branches">branches</a> planned with more features soon.

## ‚ö° | Why choose Assorion Engine?

1. Assorion Engine is incredibly fast and stable
2. Assorion's Code is much better streamlined, and much easier to mod
3. Assorion takes up less than ~70mb
4. Assorion frequently has many bug fixes and consistently gets improvements compared to the original game and many other engines

# üóíÔ∏è | Important Notes/RoadMap

### **Note for Developers**
> [!NOTE] 
> Please use the <a href="https://github.com/Assorion/FNF-Assorion-Engine/releases"><ins>**latest release**</ins></a> source code, not the cloned or downloaded source code at the top. Mainly because of working on a lot of things throughout the source code during the weeks; Which will necessitate numerous commits.
>
> Thus inevitably exists the potential that something may be broken if you use the most¬†recent **source** code, as opposed to the most recent <a href="https://github.com/Assorion/FNF-Assorion-Engine/releases"><ins>**release**</ins></a> code.

#
  **Other Notes**   
-	There has been a complete overhaul of Chartingstate. Therefore, it will probably have new bugs and will be partially confusing at first glance
-	The characters in the song are entirely un-hardcoded. Thus you can define 2 or 4 characters instead of 3. Notes have a `player` value that makes this work
-	Charts are handled differently to the base game. Absolute positions are used instead of millisecond values. In addition, notes have player values in the chart
-	Assorion Engine based off <a href="https://github.com/FunkinCrew/Funkin/releases/tag/v0.2.6">`0.2.6`</a> version of the base game, though has been radically altered
-	The Songs and Data folder have been merged into the `songs-data` folder
- Pressing the F12 key juring gameplay uses an experimental screenshot feature. When pressed, a folder and file will be created
- Web build compiles, but is full of bugs still. These will be fixed later.
  
 **RoadMap**
* [x]	Offset wizard
* [X]	Web build
* [ ]	Improvements to the chart editor
* [ ]	Events System
* [ ]	Portuguese translation
* [ ]	Fixes for newer Flixel

Take a look at <a href="https://github.com/Assorion/FNF-Assorion-Engine/blob/main/art/screenshots.md">`art/screenshots.md`</a>. 

# üõ† | Compiling

#### **Libraries:**  
Read ahead to your OS and read those instructions. Then come back here.

Run `haxelib setup <library name>` replacing `<library name>` with these libraries below:
- `hxcpp`
- `lime 7.9.0` or `lime 8.0.0`
- `openfl 9.2.1`
- `flixel 4.9.0` or `flixel 5.2.2`
- `flixel-addons 3.0.2`
- `flixel-ui 2.5.0`

#### **For Windows:**
- Install <a href="https://haxe.org/">`Haxe`</a>
- Run `haxelib setup` in CMD. Using the defaults is fine
- Install libraries above
- Run `haxelib run lime setup`. It will install extra stuff, but you should be fine
- Setup MinGW-w64 and make sure the PATH is set correctly
- Test to make sure both the `gcc` and `g++` commands work in CMD
- Run `lime test windows -D HXCPP_MINGW` in CMD. Make sure it's in the project root folder, not the source folder

#### **For Linux:**
- Install Haxe using your package manager
- Run `haxelib setup` in your terminal
- Install libraries above
- Run `haxelib run lime setup`.
- Test to make sure both `gcc` and `g++` commands work. They should already be installed in your distro
- Run `lime test linux` in your terminal

#### **If you're confused:**  
Follow a YouTube guide, or the <a href="https://github.com/FunkinCrew/Funkin#build-instructions">base game instructions</a> on compiling. Do **NOT** use **`Visual Studio's Clang-Compiler`**, please use **`MinGW-w64`**.  
Remember to install the [library versions](#libraries) listed above.

> [!WARNING] 
> Assorion has been tested with the latest versions of Lime & Flixel. These recent versions cause issues with compiling, cameras, etc. I advise that you downgrade Flixel & Lime to the versions listed above to make sure Assorion works as intended.
>
> 
> Every version of the libraries listed before are the versions that Assorion has been tested / built with, so using those versions will gurantee that Assorion will compile and behave correctly. Fixes for these issues will hopefully be implemented soon.


## üíª | Minimum Requirements

Assorion is a very lightweight engine, to confirm this Assorion has been tested on a variety of hardware.
Hardware in question ranges from an **`Intel Pentium 4 @ 2.26ghz`** to an **`AMD Ryzen 5 3600`**, **`Windows 2000 32-bit`** to **`Windows 11 64-bit`**, **`Nvidia Geforce Fx5200`**
to **`Nvidia GTX 1660`**.

> [!tip]
> Remember!  
> Any games performance will decrease with higher resolutions.  
> Lower the resolution if encountering performance issues.


The engine *should* be able to run smoothly (max framerate) on at least an **`Intel Core2 Duo E6850`** with an **`AMD Radeon R5 240`**. 
The engine runs *perfectly* on an **`Intel i7-2600`**, and an **`Nvidia GT 1030`**.

For the MinGW 64-bit build, Assorion will only run on Windows 7 or higher (tested on **`Windows Vista 64-bit`** and **`Windows 7 64-bit`**).
Several libraries of inside of `Lime.ndll` use **SSE** to **SSE4**. 32-bit builds may work on on **`Windows Vista 32-bit`**.

These should be the lowest minimum requirements to run the engine:

- **OS**: Windows 7 64-Bit or Higher

- **Processor**: Intel Celeron (SSE to SSE4, MMX) or Higher

- **Memory**: 512MB - 1GB of Ram. 256mb or Higher of VRAM

- **Storage**: ~70MB Available Space
